What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

-git creates a metadatafile .git but doesn't perform an initial commit
-no files are tracked by default
-to tell git which files it should track, otherwise it would need to track ALL the data on the PC


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

-in the staging area I define the files I want to commit with the next commit-command
 so it's like "selecting" them
-the staging area is different from the repository because you cannot compare files that are only staged
